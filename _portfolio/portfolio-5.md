<p style="text-align: justify;">
Get Disease Predictions is a responsive web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes, heart diseases, and Parkinson's using advanced machine learning models. Developed with Python, the project leverages libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for building and training the models, while Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface. The application is deployed on Heroku for easy accessibility. Collaboration and version control were managed using Git, ensuring efficient teamwork and task organization.
