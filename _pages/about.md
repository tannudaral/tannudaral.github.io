I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for all things tech and coding. With a background in Computer Science and Engineering, I've always been fascinated by the world of programming and problem-solving. 

Welcome, I am Tannu Daral, a recent graduate from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) in Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech in CSE). The path has been both challenging and rewarding, with each new project and line of code pushing me to learn and grow. From grappling with data structures and algorithms to mastering various programming languages, I've embraced the learning process wholeheartedly.
